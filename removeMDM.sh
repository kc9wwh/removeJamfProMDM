# This script was designed to be used when migration Jamf Pro instances where an MDM profile
# is installed on the systems and needs to be removed prior to the migration.
#
# To accomplish this the following will be performed:
#			- Attempt removal via Jamf binary
#			- Attempt removal via Jamf API sending an MDM UnmanageDevice command
#			- Lastly, if failed to remove MDM Profile the /var/db/ConfigurationProfiles
#             folder will be renamed.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#			- Jamf Pro
#			- Jamf Pro API User with permission to read computer objects
#			- Jamf Pro API User with permission to send management commands
#           - Script must be executed as root (due to profiles command)
#
# EXIT CODES:
#			0 - Everything is Successful
#			1 - Unable to remove MDM Profile
